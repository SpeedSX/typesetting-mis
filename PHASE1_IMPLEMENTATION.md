# Phase 1 Implementation Plan
## Typesetting MIS - Foundation Development (Months 1-3)

### Overview
Phase 1 focuses on building the core foundation of the Typesetting MIS platform, including multi-tenant architecture, authentication, basic UI framework, and essential infrastructure.

### Phase 1 Goals
- ✅ **Core platform setup** - Project structure, development environment
- ✅ **Multi-tenant architecture** - Database-per-tenant with shared services
- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization** - JWT-based auth with RBAC
- ✅ **Database schema** - Core tables and relationships
- ✅ **Basic UI framework** - React app with routing and components

### Development Timeline (12 weeks)

#### Week 1-2: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] Project structure and monorepo setup
- [x] Development environment configuration
- [x] Podman containerization
- [x] Database setup (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline

#### Week 3-4: Multi-tenant Architecture
- [ ] Database-per-tenant implementation
- [ ] Tenant management service
- [ ] Database migration system
- [x] Tenant context middleware

#### Week 5-6: Authentication Service
- [x] JWT authentication
- [x] User registration/login
- [x] Password hashing and validation
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup

#### Week 7-8: Company Management
- [ ] Company onboarding workflow
- [ ] Tenant configuration management
- [ ] User invitation system
- [ ] Company settings management

#### Week 9-10: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] React app setup with TypeScript
- [ ] Material-UI theme and components
- [ ] Routing and navigation
- [ ] State management (Redux Toolkit)
- [ ] API integration layer

#### Week 11-12: User Management & Dashboard
- [ ] User management interface
- [ ] Role and permission management
- [ ] Basic dashboard
- [ ] Settings and profile management
- [ ] Testing and documentation

### Technical Deliverables

#### 1. Backend Services
- **Authentication Service** - JWT-based auth with MFA
- **Company Management Service** - Multi-tenant company operations
- **User Management Service** - User CRUD and role management
- **Database Service** - Tenant database management
- **API Gateway** - Request routing and middleware

#### 2. Frontend Application
- **React App** - TypeScript, Material-UI, Redux Toolkit
- **Authentication Flow** - Login, registration, password reset
- **Dashboard** - Basic overview and navigation
- **User Management** - User list, roles, permissions
- **Company Settings** - Tenant configuration

#### 3. Infrastructure
- **Podman Environment** - Development and production containers
- **Database Setup** - PostgreSQL with tenant isolation
- **Redis Cache** - Session and data caching
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Multi-tenant platform with complete data isolation
- [ ] Secure authentication with role-based access control
- [ ] Responsive React frontend with Material-UI
- [ ] Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- [ ] Documentation for development and deployment

### Risk Mitigation
- **Database Performance** - Connection pooling and query optimization
- **Security** - Input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Scalability** - Microservices architecture with horizontal scaling
- **Data Integrity** - Database constraints and validation rules
