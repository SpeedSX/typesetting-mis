# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
- **Backend**: Run from [backend/](mdc:backend/) directory with `dotnet run --project TypesettingMIS.API`
- **Frontend**: Run from [frontend/](mdc:frontend/) directory with `npm run dev`
- Use PowerShell syntax in Terminal

## Code Organization
- **Feature-Based**: Group related files by feature (auth, companies, users)
- **Layer Separation**: Keep API, Core, Infrastructure, and Application layers separate
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow C# conventions for backend, camelCase for frontend. 
- Use C# 12 at least, prefer C# 13.
