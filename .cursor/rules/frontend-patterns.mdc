# Frontend Development Patterns

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript

## API Service Patterns
- Centralize API calls in [api.ts](mdc:frontend/src/services/api.ts)
- Use Axios with interceptors for auth tokens
- Include `withCredentials: true` for httpOnly cookies

## Type Safety
- Define types in [types/](mdc:frontend/src/types/) directory
- Use interfaces for component props

## Form Patterns
- Use controlled components with state
- Implement validation with error states
- Show loading states during async operations
- Clear errors on form close

## Authentication Flow
- Use [ProtectedRoute](mdc:frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx) for route protection
